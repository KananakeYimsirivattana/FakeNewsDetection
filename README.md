# FakeNewsDetection
This project is based on analysis and classification of news on Twitter using an LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) and RF (Random Forest) to Identify fake news or not. 

Developed using python pythainlp for Natural Language Processing and Tensorflow, pandas with WordCloud, Sklearn and Seaborn for visualizations. 
# Dataset
1.  Fake news : Fake.CSV
2.  Real news : Real.CSV
3.  manual_testing.CSV is a file that merges the two files together by categorize fake news for class 0 and Real news for class 1. 
# Libraries
1.  pythainlp
2.  numpy
3.  sklearn
4.  matplotlib
5.  seaborn
6.  wordcloud
